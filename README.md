# DOCUMENT ARCHIVING SYSTEM FOR ST. TERESA FUNERAL HOMES.

A business IT capabilities must be established and improved over time to derive
value and achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Most people do not expect to see
technology in funeral homes. On the other hand, funeral homes must continuously
evaluate how they conduct business and make necessary adjustments to improve
service standards, meet changing customer needs and wants, and maintain a
competitive edge.

As a core technology for automated document processing, information extraction
has been quite successful in several application domains. The documents are either
confidential or accessible to everyone in an organization. Records must be sorted,
searched, accessed, copied, modified, and sometimes transmitted over a computer
network.

The primary function of a Document Archiving System (DAS) is to facilitate the
free flow of records through an organization and to ensure the availability of information
upon request. This system would be capable of keeping a record of the various versions
created and modified by different users (history tracking). Increasingly, DAS is vital to
organizations and information-using employees. It helps the organization achieve more
efficient operations by reducing transaction costs, automating processes, improving
capacity, minimizing errors, and saving labor.
Sta. Teresa Funeral Homes has been in the industry since 1993 and is standing
firm despite various challenges in this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the economy is at a critical level. Being in the business for decades means uncountable
records.
Moreover, since the establishment operates manually, all documents are pen and
paper. These large amounts of files to be maintained necessitate a large physical
storage area. Old records tend to become indistinct and unreadable as time passes.
This traditional way of record-keeping does not offer security. Other employees can
access data by just plugging it into file cabinets.
The researchers aim to provide Sta. Teresa Funeral Homes with an excellent
quality bespoke Document Archiving System and develop a system that can be tailored
to their particular requirements while also furnishing exceptional security and simplicity
of use. An integrated archiving and analytics solution for enhanced processing and
review is an alternative for organizations wishing to expedite this procedure. This
process is at the heart of online archiving, and it may integrate with the idea of the
structure established in classic archives management theory. 

GENERAL OBJECTIVE
The main goal of this study is to develop a Document Archiving System for Sta.
Teresa Funeral Homes.
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
1. Develop a system that can add, edit, and manage customer information and
files.
2. Develop a system that can manage the uploading and archiving of the
following document:
2.1 Burial Service Contracts




THE PROPOSED SYSTEM

The proposed system is recommended to the business owner to keep the world’s
technological transition. The proposed system is accessible via two distinct accounts:
the administrator and the staff user. Because the proposed system can upload, archive,
and download items and details, the researchers restricted adding, editing, and deleting
to administrators only to avoid accidental removal of confidential files. Also, the
proposed system consists of qualities and functions such as Smooth and Minimal UI,
Ease of use, and In-site transactions


PROPOSED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY
Waterfall methodology is the recommended system development methodology.
The developers carried out the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) steps, such as
Requirement Analysis, System Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and
Maintenance following the Waterfall Model to help the product development team fix
bugs in the middle of the project. Traditional software development methods require five
distinct phases namely Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Support.
Intermediate steps in software development using this methodology fall under these
phases.

Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
To start the project, all of the requirements need to be planned and done with
some research before creating a document. Identify and formulate a strategy that can
solve the problem.
Phase 2: System Design
The requirements are fully prepared and need an investigation of the problem. It
must define the “what” requirements that are necessary for solving the problem such as
specification, process, and defining all the architecture of the system.
Phase 3: Implementation
It needs to be input and converts design systems requirements and documents
into software implementations and once all phases have been completed, the
implementation starts the discussion about the progress toward achieving
requirements. The existing software is updated with new features and issues resolved
after iterations.
Phase 4: Testing
To ensure that the proposed system’s program is bug-free and compatible, it
should be run in some tests together with the other systems. They are considering
everything else that the developers have already produced. The team runs a series of
tests to ensure that the code is correct and the business objectives of the solution are
met.
Phase 5: Deployment
This phase must be applied after the system testing. The system can deploy in
the market once the system is completed and ready to be installed on servers and
made available to users for demonstration or practical use.
Phase 6: Maintenance
To avoid some issues regarding the system, maintaining and checking would be
the best solution. Maintenance must necessarily apply to the system to help, improve
previous ideas, and make the system to the next level or better versions. The
suggestions for resolving issues that arose during the previous phases need to be
delivered and evaluated.

Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, the staff of Sta. Teresa Funeral Homes were delighted
that the Document Archiving System is the answer to their manual keeping of all
confidential files and documents. (1) The administrators are allowed to store record
expenses, employee salary, and collectible accounts, (2) administrators can upload and
delete files, (3) it allows users to view files, and (4) allows staff to archive their
documents (Burial Service Contracts, Guarantee Letters from Department of Social
Welfare and Development and Office of the President).
Therefore, the developer found that the Document Archiving System met the
project objectives.

Recommendation

Based on the experiences in developing the system, the developer recommends
that future researchers may expand the scope of keeping a stack of archiving
documents to improve the performance of Sta. Teresa Funeral Homes. Future
developers can also add features like strengthening the security of the document
the archiving system, implementing persistent data back-ups, allowing access to the
documents to as many people as possible, automating workflows in compliance with
proper classification, boosting the decision-making process, and enhancing the
optimization of business processes
